# healthy-coping

Healthy Coping is a Google Home assistant application that acts as an innovative intervention strategy to assist elderly patients with self-management of T2DM. 
* Emphasizes the use of a voice interface rather than a strictly tactile one in order to provide older patients with the opportunity to easily engage in practical application of clinical care management. 
* Combines the voice interface of Google Home for hosting the chat bot and a web interface for data visualization in order to reduce the burden of monitoring diabetic consequences for the user.

Frameworks used: 
* Node.js for webhook and AngularJS for web interface
